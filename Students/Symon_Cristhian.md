# Symon Cristhian

## Whoami:
Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student currently residing in Manaus, Brazil. I like to code, read, play video games, listen to music and hang out with my friends! 

I study at Universidade Federal do Amazonas where I have my first contact with progamation and I met wonderful people who help me in my journey.

This is my first experience with open-source and version control system and I  have to assume that I am really enjoying it.


## Languages that I know:


- Python
- C/C++
- Javascript
